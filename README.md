A graphical simulation for HPF, FCFS, RR and SRTN and calculating the Average Turnaround Time and Average Weighted Turnaround Time.
Your input file should be like the attached example.
1st line : number of processes.
2nd line : mean and standard deviation of normal dist for arrival time.
3rd line: mean and standard deviation of normal dist for burst time.
4th line : lamda of possion dist for priority.
You should generate the processes first by Process Generator Module.
